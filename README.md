# SimpleCanva
Assessment project that implements a canvas to add image and resize

### Features
1. ✅ Creating a scrollable canvas view.
2. ✅ Having a “+” button that presents a sheet with images from the endpoint.
3. ✅ Adding a selected image to the canvas.
4. ✅ Selecting items by tapping on them. Deselecting by tapping outside the item when it’s selected.
5. ✅ Moving items around in the canvas by panning while it’s selected.
6. ✅ While moving items around in the canvas, we want the items to snap (round off its position to some appropriate but arbitrary precision) when the item is near the top, left, right or bottom part of the canvas or other items on the canvas. It should also show yellow lines highlighting when snapping occurs. (We have attached an example video from SCRL to show how it’s working in our editor, please try it yourself in the app to see more precisely).
7. ✅ Scaling items with pinch gesture
